# üöÅ Follow-Me Drone API ‚Äì FastAPI Deployment

This project simulates the behavior of an autonomous **Follow-Me Drone** using a lightweight and deployable **FastAPI-based web service**.  
The API receives real-time movement commands (like "up", "left", "forward") and returns simulated drone actions, acting as a backend controller for drone navigation logic.

It is ideal for demonstrating drone command control logic, IoT integrations, and deploying machine learning-enabled drone modules in real-world applications.

## ‚ú® Features
- ‚úÖ Built using **FastAPI** ‚Äì high performance & easy to deploy.
- ‚úÖ Supports drone movement commands via RESTful API.
- ‚úÖ Easy to extend with real drone control, object detection, or reinforcement learning.
- ‚úÖ Ready for deployment on **Render**, **Hugging Face Spaces**, or **AWS**.

## üîß API Endpoints

### `GET /`
> Health check endpoint  
**Response:** 
```json
{ "message": "Follow-Me Drone API is up and running!" }
```

### `POST /move-drone/`
> Send a movement command to the drone

**Request JSON**:
```json
{ "direction": "up" }
```

**Valid directions**: `up`, `down`, `left`, `right`, `forward`, `backward`

**Successful Response**:
```json
{ "status": "success", "action": "Drone is moving up" }
```

**Invalid Direction Response**:
```json
{ "status": "error", "message": "Invalid direction. Please use up, down, left, right, forward, or backward." }
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. **Run the server**:
    ```bash
    uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
    ```

3. **Test API**:
    - Open browser at [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs) for Swagger UI.
    - Or use `curl`:
      ```bash
      curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/move-drone/" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"direction": "forward"}'
      ```
